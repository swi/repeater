- **FR1.5**: Support working directory specification

### FR2: Scheduling Modes
- **FR2.1**: Fixed interval execution (`--every 30s`)
- **FR2.2**: Count-based execution (`--times 100`)
- **FR2.3**: Duration-based execution (`--for 1h`)
- **FR2.4**: Rate-limited execution (`--rate-limit 100/1h`)
- **FR2.5**: Immediate execution option (`--immediate`)

### FR3: Stop Conditions
- **FR3.1**: Stop after specified count of executions
- **FR3.2**: Stop after specified duration
- **FR3.3**: Stop on signal (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
- **FR3.4**: Stop after consecutive failures threshold
- **FR3.5**: Stop at specific time (`--until 15:30`)

### FR4: Error Handling
- **FR4.1**: Configurable behavior on command failure
- **FR4.2**: Continue execution on errors (`--continue-on-error`)
- **FR4.3**: Pattern-based success/failure detection
- **FR4.4**: Maximum failure threshold before stopping
- **FR4.5**: Graceful shutdown without orphaned processes

### FR5: Output Management
- **FR5.1**: Stream command output in real-time
- **FR5.2**: Suppress output (`--quiet`)

- **FR5.5**: Output filtering and formatting

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- **NFR1.1**: Minimal overhead between command executions (<10ms)
- **NFR1.2**: Support for high-frequency execution (up to 1/second)
- **NFR1.3**: Efficient memory usage for long-running operations
- **NFR1.4**: CPU usage proportional to command execution frequency

### NFR2: Reliability
- **NFR2.1**: 99.9% uptime for continuous operations
- **NFR2.2**: Accurate timing within 1% of specified intervals

### NFR4: Compatibility
- **NFR4.1**: Support Linux, macOS, Windows
- **NFR4.2**: Compatible with all POSIX-compliant shells
- **NFR4.3**: No external dependencies for core functionality
- **NFR4.4**: Integration with existing monitoring tools

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Basic Continuous Execution

**US1.1**: As a DevOps engineer, I want to run health checks every 30 seconds so that I can monitor service availability.
```bash
rpr interval --every 30s -- curl -f https://api.example.com/health
```

**US1.2**: As a QA engineer, I want to run a test suite 100 times so that I can identify flaky tests.
```bash
rpr count --times 100 -- npm test
```

**US1.3**: As a system administrator, I want to monitor disk usage for 8 hours so that I can track growth patterns.
```bash
rpr duration --for 8h --every 5m -- df -h
```

### Epic 2: Rate-Limited Operations

**US2.1**: As an API developer, I want to make API calls within rate limits so that I don't exceed quotas.
```bash
rpr rate-limit --limit 1000 --window 1h -- curl https://api.example.com/data
```

**US2.2**: As a data engineer, I want to coordinate multiple ETL processes so that they don't overwhelm the database.
```bash
rpr rate-limit --daemon --resource-id "database" --limit 10/1m -- ./etl-job.sh
```

### Epic 3: Advanced Scheduling

**US3.1**: As a DevOps engineer, I want adaptive intervals based on response time so that I can optimize monitoring frequency.
```bash
rpr adaptive --target-latency 100ms --min 10s --max 5m -- health-check.sh
```

**US3.2**: As a system administrator, I want cron-like scheduling with better error handling so that I can replace fragile cron jobs.
```bash
rpr schedule --cron "0 */6 * * *" --continue-on-error -- backup.sh
```
