## Development Methodology

This project follows **strict Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with:
- **Red-Green-Refactor cycles** for all feature development
- **Comprehensive test coverage** (85%+ across all packages)
- **Integration testing** for end-to-end functionality validation
- **Performance testing** ensuring timing accuracy and resource efficiency
- **Race condition testing** for concurrent execution safety

Every feature was implemented following TDD principles with failing tests written first, minimal implementation to pass tests, and subsequent refactoring for code quality.
