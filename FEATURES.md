## 🔄 Planned Major Refactor: CLI Strategy Interface (v1.0.0)

**Status**: In Development
**Priority**: High (Breaking change window before public release)
**Timeline**: 10-15 days
**Effort**: 80-120 hours

### Refactor Overview
Transform Repeater from mode-based to strategy-based interface, adopting Patience's intuitive approach while preserving all existing functionality.

#### Target Transformation
```bash
# FROM: Mode-based (current)
rpr backoff --initial-delay 1s --attempts 5 -- command
rpr interval --every 30s --times 10 -- command
rpr rate-limit --rate 100/1h -- command

# TO: Strategy-based (target)
rpr exponential --initial-delay 1s --attempts 5 -- command
rpr interval --every 30s --times 10 -- command  
rpr rate-limit --rate 100/1h -- command
```

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Analysis & Design (1-2 days)
- **1.1 Strategy Mapping Analysis**: Map current modes to strategy names
- **1.2 CLI Architecture Design**: Design new subcommand structure
- **1.3 Migration Strategy**: Plan deprecation timeline and compatibility

#### Phase 2: Core Strategy Implementation (3-4 days)
- **2.1 Add Missing Mathematical Strategies**:
  - `fibonacci` - Moderate growth retry (1s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 5s, 8s...)
  - `linear` - Predictable incremental retry (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s...)
  - `polynomial` - Customizable growth retry with exponent
  - `decorrelated-jitter` - AWS-recommended distributed retry
- **2.2 Refactor Existing Strategies**: `backoff` → `exponential` for clarity
- **2.3 Preserve Execution Modes**: Keep `interval`, `count`, `duration`, `cron`

#### Phase 3: Parameter Unification (2-3 days)
- **3.1 Standardize Common Parameters**: `--attempts`, `--timeout`, `--success-pattern`
- **3.2 Strategy-Specific Parameters**: Tailored parameters per mathematical strategy

#### Phase 4: CLI Infrastructure (2-3 days)
- **4.1 Help System Redesign**: Strategy-organized main help
- **4.2 Subcommand Architecture**: Strategy-based parsing and validation
- **4.3 Abbreviation System**: `exp`, `fib`, `lin`, `poly`, `dj` for new strategies

#### Phase 5: Backward Compatibility (1-2 days)
- **5.1 Legacy Alias System**: Support old interface with deprecation warnings
- **5.2 Migration Guide**: Documentation for transitioning users

#### Phase 6: Documentation & Testing (2-3 days)
- **6.1 Update Documentation**: Rewrite with strategy-first examples
- **6.2 Test Strategy Coverage**: Comprehensive testing of new interface

### Strategy Mapping Table
| Current Mode | New Strategy | Parameters | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| `backoff` | `exponential` | `--base-delay`, `--multiplier`, `--max-delay` | Direct rename for clarity |
| `adaptive` | `adaptive` | `--base-interval`, `--learning-rate` | Keep as-is (clear name) |
| `rate-limit` | `rate-limit` | `--rate`, `--retry-pattern` | Execution mode, not strategy |
| `interval` | `interval` | `--every`, `--times`, `--for` | Execution mode, not strategy |
| `count` | `count` | `--times` | Execution mode, not strategy |
| `duration` | `duration` | `--for`, `--every` | Execution mode, not strategy |
| `cron` | `cron` | `--cron`, `--timezone` | Execution mode, not strategy |

### New Strategies to Add
| Strategy | Primary Use Case | Key Parameters |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| `fibonacci` | Moderate growth retry | `--base-delay`, `--max-delay` |
| `linear` | Predictable incremental retry | `--increment`, `--max-delay` |
| `polynomial` | Customizable growth retry | `--base-delay`, `--exponent`, `--max-delay` |
| `decorrelated-jitter` | High-scale distributed retry | `--base-delay`, `--multiplier`, `--max-delay` |

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Intuitive strategy selection (`rpr fibonacci` vs `rpr backoff --fibonacci`)
- ✅ Mathematical strategy names match user mental models
- ✅ Consistent parameter naming across strategies
- ✅ Backward compatibility with deprecation path
- ✅ Enhanced strategy discoverability via help system
- ✅ No functionality lost in refactor

### Migration Strategy
```bash
# Legacy support with deprecation warnings
$ rpr backoff --initial-delay 1s -- command
⚠️  'backoff' is deprecated, use 'exponential' instead

# Automatic parameter mapping
$ rpr backoff --initial-delay 1s -- command
# → internally maps to: rpr exponential --base-delay 1s -- command
```
